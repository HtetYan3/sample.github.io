				<p> Marvel, one of the best cinematic company, becomes more successful these days. Recently a new series,<bold> Hawkeye</bold>, was released. First two episodes of Hawkeye got a lot of fame and, now people are waiting to watch episode three.  In my opinion, Hawkeye is really  a good series and, it is incredibly worth -watching series of 2021.<bold> What if</bold> series can also be said to be one of the best animation series ever.  CGI effects in this series is astonishing and the edictors and graphic designers had to create every single scene in details.</p>
